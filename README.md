# This is the Django Project where you can add any video.
# Make changes in the settings.py and fill the required AWS credentials for storing the videos.
# Run "python manage.py createsuperuser" to create an admin user for the app.
# Then run "python manage.py makemigrations" and then "python manage.py migrate" in the terminal.
# To run this app locally write the command "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal.
# After that go to Admin page and login with the required credentials.
# Then add or delete a video as required through the admin page.
# The video will be added to the AWS S3 accordingly.
